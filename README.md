Welcome to **AgriVision**! This project was developed during the **Code Odyssey Hackathon** by **Team Synergy Squad** from **K J Somaiya Institute of Technology**. Our AI-powered solution aims to revolutionize agriculture by detecting crop diseases early and providing sustainable, eco-friendly interventions, leading to healthier crops and reduced chemical usage.

## 📋 Problem Statement
Agricultural productivity faces significant threats from pests and diseases, resulting in substantial crop losses each year. Traditional methods of pest control are inefficient and environmentally harmful. **AgriVision** leverages AI and drone imagery to tackle these challenges by providing real-time insights to farmers for better crop management.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- **🕵️ Early Detection**: Identify early signs of pest infestations and diseases using high-resolution drone imagery and sensor data.
- **⏰ Real-Time Alerts**: Send immediate notifications to farmers about detected issues, allowing timely intervention.
- **🌿 Targeted Solutions**: Recommend precise, eco-friendly interventions like precision spraying or introducing natural predators.
- **🌱 Minimize Crop Losses**: Promote sustainable farming practices by minimizing the use of harmful chemicals and reducing crop loss.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

- **AI Model**: A deep learning **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on labeled datasets of crop images, detecting early signs of pests and diseases with high accuracy.
- **Drone & Sensor Imagery**: Collect high-resolution images and data to precisely monitor the health of crops in real-time.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Alerts are sent to farmers with specific recommendations for eco-friendly interventions like natural predator introduction or precision spraying.
- **Web Application**: Farmers can access the system through a web app, showing a **dashboard** with health metrics, trends, and weather updates to help manage their farms effectively.
- **Weather Integration**: The platform provides daily weather updates to help farmers plan their activities better.
